        <h3> Mods Setup (recommended)</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> 7th Sister (Health, Speed; 317-353) </li>
            <li> 8th Brother (Crit Dmg/Chance; 293-307)</li>
            <li> 5th Brother (Health, Speed; 303)</li>
            <li> Grand Inquisitor (Health, Offense; 276-288)</li>
            <li> 9th Sister (Defense; 231-254)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Things to Remember</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> No AOE abilities unless you have tenacity up. This is achieved with 6 stacks of purge then using GI's right-most ability. </li>
            <li> Save GI's cleanse (middle ability) for when your inquisitors have 6 or more dots. </li>
            <li> Save 5th Brother's stun for wave 2 unless absolutely needed. </li>
            <li> Use 7th Sister's heal on the lowest ally on her 2nd turn. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> General Strategy </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> 7th Sister: Daze on Nebit </li>
            <li> 5th Brother: Basic on Nebit for purge</li>
            <li> GI: If Nebit has 6 stacks of purge, use the right-most ability (tenacity up). Otherwise, just basic attack on Nebit to stack purge. </li>
            <li> 8th Brother: If you have tenacity up, use the aoe and target Scavenger. Otherwise, just basic attack on Nebit to stack purge.</li>
            <li> 9th Sister: If you have tenacity up, use the aoe and target Scavenger. Otherwise, just basic attack on Nebit to stack purge</li> 
            <li> Once Nebit has 6 stacks and you have tenacity up, use all aoe and get Scavenger first.</li>
        </ol>
